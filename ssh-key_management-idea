Guide lines for managing ssh keys at an organization:
----------------------------------------------------

We will use LDAP (source of truth for UID/GID and relations), salt stack and an integrator tool/scripts to manage ssh key management

LDAP will define the groups, users and will populate with public keys

Assign a salt role to host, and assign the required groups to the host (we can write a tool to do it), the roles and groups need to be added as a grain in minion salt config file. salt stack grains will dectate the groups and salt roles assigned to the host(minion)

salt stack will distribute the keys of the users that are part of the assigned groups on hosts. under users home directories ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

If a user does not exist, salt stack will create the user and will populate the keys

Any accounts on the host that do not have a corresponding UID or username assigned via groups will be removed via a 'userdel' command.

If UID/GIDs and permissions are wrong salt stack will fix them and will populate the keys.

Salt stack can have module to executes various commands usermod, userdel commands along with populating the keys.
